<title>This is an SFL file
<text>Here is some text explaining 
how an sfl file works 
new lines don't make a difference and this will 
all be compiled as one line.    

Two lines will make a difference and make this text a new paragraph.


Three lines will make this a new paragraph with a space between the two, in 
essence making each blank line a \n character, 
~
~
and each tilda is used only as a filler character to make the file clearer, 
they will be treated as if they don't exist.
~
<code>const some_code = "code";

// Each new line of code needs a blank space between them

function new_doc(){


    // TODO


}
