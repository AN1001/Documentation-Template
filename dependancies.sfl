<title>Dependancies
<text>ArnavDB does not use any Dependancies, however it will require 
you to install the user side script for ease of access. Additionally you will need to 
download the Wrangler API for local access of the database.

If you don't want to install any dependancies you can just use the online interface.
<code>npx -install Wrangler
